### ðŸŽ¯ Post-Commit Decision Process

After all files are committed, the system will ask:

```
Â¿Quieres realizar un merge con la rama dev o continuar trabajando en esta rama?

Opciones:
1. Merge to dev (Feature Complete) - Fusionar cambios y limpiar rama
2. Continue Working - Seguir trabajando en la rama actual
3. Deploy to Master - Preparar despliegue a producciÃ³n (requiere confirmaciÃ³n)
```

### ðŸš€ Professional Workflow Advantages

1. **Atomic Commits**: Each file gets its own commit with specific description
2. **Clear History**: Git log shows precise changes per file
3. **Easy Rollback**: Can revert specific file changes independently
4. **Better Collaboration**: Team members can understand changes granularly
5. **Professional Standards**: Follows international git workflow best practices

### ðŸ“Š Implementation Metrics

- **Total Files to Process**: 35
- **Estimated Commit Time**: ~10 minutes for all files
- **Commit Message Quality**: Professional standard with detailed descriptions
- **Branch Management**: Proper feature branch workflow
- **Version Control**: Semantic versioning ready for production

### ðŸ”§ Next Steps

1. Execute `/git-commit` command
2. Process all 35 files individually
3. Generate professional commit messages
4. Ask for merge decision
5. Execute chosen workflow (merge to dev or continue working)
